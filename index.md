# Introduction

## Who are you?

Hi, my name's Rich. I am an undergraduate student studying computer science at the University of Washington's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. I have taken quite a few courses in CSE here, and heard a lot about most of the other courses that I have not taken personally (or taken yet!)

## What is this website?

Just like just about every student in the Allen School, you've probably had, at some point, had to make tricky decisions about what courses to take what quarter. For me, this was a constant battle every quarter, and it always frustrated me that there was no single really good source of information on the matter.

Instead, I had to ask around everyone I knew (friends, friends of friends, acquaintances, TAs, strangers, and more!), take a look at what other people had said in various places (Reddit, Ed message boards, Discords, and more), go to the official course websites to see what they were like, and then aggregate all of this information together for me to make my choices.

I admit, I definitely go too overboard in this process. But, over the course of doing this, I've come to gather a lot of information about courses, information that some have suggested I should refine into some central location for future generations of CSE students. Put briefly, I intended to collect my thoughts on the wide variety of computer science and engineering courses available at the University of Washington, and write about my experiences, the experiences of people I know, and also what I've heard in the hopes it will be useful for future students deciding what to take.

And thus, that's the website you're viewing right now!

##  How do I use this website?
At the top, there should be a search bar where you can search for any particular topic you're looking for.

Otherwise, you should just browse the relevant sections you're interested in! For the comprehensive picture, start by reading through the [Disclaimers, Caveats, and Limitations](/01%20-%20disclaimer.md), and then getting an understanding of how everything is structured on the [Course Review Structure](/02%20-%20structure.md) page.

##  What exists out there already?

Here's a brief list of sources (some may require a login with CSE credentials) where you can go to find other information on various courses, though I hope to be as comprehensive as possible with my reviews so that you will not need these as much.

\*As of February 2024, this website contains outdated information, in particular with regards to classes that are not even offered anymore. Some of the courses have been deprecated for almost a decade - the last offering for them was back in 2015!

##  Influences and Inspirations

This sort of website is not some unique idea I had. In particular, I would like to credit Fan Pu Zeng of Carnegie Mellon University and Jasper van de Jeugt of Ghent University for their computer science course reviews targetting courses for their particular institutions. I read through these course review pages to get a better idea of how better to write mine, and it was quite helpful!

##  Can I reach out or ask you more questions?

I don't anticipate that very many people would want to reach out to me, but on the off chance you'd like to because you've got questions or comments or anything of the sort, please feel free!

I can best be reached via my email (rc2002 [at] uw [dot] edu) or my Discord (```computationalist```).
