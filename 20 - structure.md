# Course Review Structure

For my reviews, I will try to focus on three main aspects of a course: difficulty, enjoyability, and practicality. Most of this is somewhat subjective and dependent on many factors, so I will not attempt to assign courses particular numerical ratings for any of these areas. Instead, I will focus on highlighting the most important inforamtion you should know as someone who is planning to take a course.

## Difficulty
Difficulty is simple - just how hard the class is. A lot of factors go into this, including how complex the concepts are, how much time students need to invest in the class, if there are any particularly difficult projects or exams, if the pace of instruction is slow or fast, and if the course dives deep or remains a more broad, shallow survey of topics.

## Enjoyability
This is by far the most subjective of the three areas, because everything I will mention regarding a course is entirely from my perspective and the material I enjoy will be very different from the material other people enjoy. However, there are still some broad generalization statements that apply to many other people I know of who have taken various classes, and there are generally things about certain classes people enjoy and do not enjoy that I will try to mention.

## Practicality
Technically speaking, every course could be extremely practical if you wished to specialize in the particular subfield of CSE that that class covers. That aside, there are certain classes that are extremely significant across many fields, to the extent that at other top universities (the likes of MIT, or CMU, or Stanford) they would be considered mandatory core classes rather than optional electives. Therefore, I have opted to keep this aspect of a course optional in my course reviews (or else I would repeat myself over and over with the previous claim) and focus instead on highlighting courses that are truly significant in their practicality.
