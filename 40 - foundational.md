# 300-Levels, Part 1: Foundational Core Courses
These are the 300-level courses that are required for everyone in computer science. They cover extremely foundational material, important for many of the 400-level courses. Almost everything you study in the 400-levels will demand a strong foundation in the 300-levels, so it's important to make sure you really get the basics down well. 

The courses are largely very disjoint from each other and each is very unique, so they often pair well together to construct quarterly schedules where you have a nice variety of different kinds of courses (more on why I think this is a good idea on the section about [Building Schedules](/150%20-%20building%20schedules.md)).

I consider them separate from the non-mandatory 300-level courses (which)
