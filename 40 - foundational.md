# 300-Levels, Part 1: Foundational Core Courses
These are the 300-level courses that are required for everyone in computer science. They cover extremely foundational material, important for many of the 400-level courses. Almost everything you study in the 400-levels will demand a strong foundation in the 300-levels, so it's important to make sure you really get the basics down well. 

The courses are largely very disjoint from each other and each is very unique, so they often pair well together to construct quarterly schedules where you have a nice variety of different kinds of courses (more on why I think this is a good idea on the section about [Building Schedules](/150%20-%20building%20schedules.md)).

I consider them separate from the non-mandatory 300-level courses, which I consider [Intermediate Courses](45%20-%20intermediate.html) owing to the fact that most of the non-mandatory 300-level courses actually have at least one of the foundational courses on this page as a pre-requisite. Those intermediate courses can therefore serve more as the middle ground to ease into some of the 400-levels.

## CSE 311 - Foundations of Computing I
The name is not particularly descriptive of the material covered in the course. In some regard, this class should really be considered a "Fundamentals of Theoretical Computer Science" course, owing to the fact that the course is entirely theoretical, focusing on such topics as logic, formal proof, a formal look at mathematical constructs (such as very basic [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), [set theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory), and [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)), models of computation such as [automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory) and formal languages, before wrapping up with some of the most important results in computer science, such as the [continuum hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis)
